# MontagneMVC

## Preface

This is a framework I have been writing as an exercise in exploring how PHP frameworks function. 

If you are reading this, **DO NOT USE IT IN YOUR PROJECT**. This is an exercise in exploration, not a proposal for how the future of the web should be written.

## Constraints

I imposed the following constraints on myself for this project, and to a lesser extent the projects that use it:

### No External Libraries

This code should run on PHP code I have written myself only. This is to remove any licensing issues with the project, and also so I can use it as a demonstration of my abilities as a developer.
